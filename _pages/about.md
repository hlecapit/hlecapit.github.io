Since 2011, I am Ass. Professor of Computer Science at Nantes Université, Polytech Nantes. I am the head of the [Data Science Master](https://polytech.univ-nantes.fr/fr/les-formations/masters-internationaux/data-science-masters-degree-ds) program since 2017. Before that, I obtained my PhD in 2009, University of La Rochelle, France. I obtained the HDR in 2024 at  Nantes Université.

I am doing my research with the [LS2N](https://www.ls2n.fr) lab, and more specifically with the DUKe research team.

My general research area is applied machine learning for comparing and learning representation of complex data, with an emphasis on graphs.
I am also interested in the general thematic of equity, fairness, transparency and explainability of AI models being used : graph neural networks, graph transformers, reinforcement learning.
Applications particularly include Open Educationnal Ressources : recommendation, question-answering, difficulty assessment, curricula ...
