Since 2011, I am Ass. Professor of Computer Science at Nantes Université, Polytech Nantes. I am the head the [Data Science Master](https://polytech.univ-nantes.fr/fr/les-formations/masters-internationaux/data-science-masters-degree-ds) program since 2017. Before that, I obtained my PhD in 2009, University of La Rochelle, France.

I am doing my research with the [LS2N](https://www.ls2n.fr) lab, and more specifically with the DUKe research team.

My general research area is applied machine learning for comparing and learning representation of complex data.
I am also interested in the general thematic of equity, fairness, transparency and explainability of AI models.
Applications particularly include Open Educationnal Ressources and  their easy usability for any user.
