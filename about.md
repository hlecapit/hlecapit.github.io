I am Ass. Professor of Computer Science at Nantes Université, Polytech Nantes. I am doing my research with the LS2N lab, and more specifically with the DUKe research team.

My general research area is applied machine learning for comparing and learning representation of complex data.
I am also interested in the general thematic of equity, fairness, transparency and explainability of AI models.
Applications particularly include Open Educationnal Ressources and  their easy usability for any user.
