The CLARA project is  about to start !



<!--more-->
CLARA project aims to empower teachers to facilitate the creation of licensable educational resources based on existing ones. Our approach will suggest a relevant set of educational resources such that these are coherent with a course sketch and have compatible licenses. The main challenges we will face are how to enrich a network of educational resources using AI algorithms, and how to guarantee a minimal set of license-compatible educational resources relevant to a given course goal with query relaxation techniques. We will exploit educational resources provided by the French Ministry of Education and the X5-GON project.

 This project has received a French government support granted to the Labex Cominlabs excellence laboratory and managed by the National Research Agency in the “Investing for the Future” program under reference ANR-10-LABX-07-01
